# Project Nexus – Backend Engineering Journey

*A documentation of my learning experience in the ALX Africa ProDev Backend Engineering Program.*

## Overview of the ProDev Backend Engineering Program

The ProDev Backend Engineering program by ALX Africa is an intensive, industry-aligned backend development curriculum designed to build strong foundational and professional engineering skills.
It emphasizes real-world project execution, collaborative engineering practices, and mastery of modern backend tools and technologies.

Through hands-on projects, structured learning paths, and peer collaboration, I’ve gained practical exposure to designing scalable systems, building APIs, deploying services, and applying industry best practices.

## Major Learnings

### Key Technologies Covered

During the program, I worked extensively with industry-relevant backend technologies, including:

- Python – core language for backend logic and scripting

- Django – full-featured web framework for building robust applications

- Django REST Framework (DRF) – building REST APIs

- GraphQL – alternative API query language for flexible data fetching

## Important Backend Development Concepts

### Database Design

- Normalization and schema planning

- Relational database modeling

- Handling migrations effectively

- Query optimization and indexing

### Asynchronous Programming

- Intro to async in Python (asyncio)

- When and why to use async vs sync

- Improving throughput for I/O-bound operations

### Caching Strategies

- Redis-based caching

- Reducing redundant expensive operations

- TTL, cache invalidation strategies

- Using caching to improve API performance

## Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented

### Challenge 1: Designing scalable APIs

- Solution: Adopted REST best practices, proper routing, pagination, filtering, and versioning.

### Challenge 2: Debugging asynchronous behavior

- Solution: Utilized async debugging tools, broke logic into smaller tasks, and relied on logging.

### Challenge 3: Containerizing complex apps

- Solution: Learned multi-stage Docker builds, environment variables, and Docker Compose for services.

### Challenge 4: CI/CD automation issues

- Solution: Configured linting, testing, and build pipelines using GitHub Actions; used YAML matrix jobs.

## Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

- Write clean, modular, and reusable code
- Document APIs and complex functions clearly
- Use environment variables and keep secrets out of source control
- Leverage virtual environments and dependency management
- Think in terms of scalability from the beginning
- Test early, test often
- Consistency in commit messages and project structure matters
- Collaboration and code reviews strengthen engineering maturity
Docker – containerization and environment consistency

CI/CD – automation pipelines for building, testing, and deployment
